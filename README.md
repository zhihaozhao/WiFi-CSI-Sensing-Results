# WiFi-CSI Sensing Results Repository

This repository contains experimental results, logs, and generated visualizations for the WiFi-CSI sensing project.

## Directory Structure

- `results/` - Main experimental results
- `results_cpu/` - CPU-based experiment results  
- `results_gpu/` - GPU-based experiment results
- `logs/` - Training and evaluation logs
- `plots/` - Generated plots and visualizations
- `figs/` - Figure files for papers
- `tables/` - Generated data tables
- `cache/` - Cached intermediate results

## Usage

This repository is designed to work with the main WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Core repository.

## Data Format

Results are typically stored as:
- JSON files for metrics and configurations
- NPZ files for numerical data arrays
- Log files for training/evaluation traces
- PNG/PDF files for visualizations

## Note

Large files should be managed carefully. Consider using Git LFS for files >100MB if needed.
